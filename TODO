DONE - unearth how the socket.io chat demo on AWS works
DONE - put my own socket.io / aws server up
- install simple signalling server on it
- use it as signalling server for simple peer

BUT IDEA

Why do we need a signalling server?
How long is signalling data valid for?
Can I generate my "signalling code" ( an opaque block of, say, b64 or whatever, or a QR code or whatever )
A QR code is more than enough to contain signalling offer key information ( for data channel, around 400 bytes )

But still these only live for like 30 seconds. I read.
